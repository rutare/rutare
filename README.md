I am @rutare. I am an amatuer game dev & music composer. Right now I am learning Ruby as it is used by RPG MAKER VX ACE (RPGツクールVX ACE),
a program I am trying my hardest to use.

I have some knowledge of Japanese and a good grasp of English, so I can perform Japanese to English translation.

You can listen to my music at https://rutare12.newgrounds.com/.
